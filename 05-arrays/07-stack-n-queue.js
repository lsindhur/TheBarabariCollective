//but why does this happen 
//why is one data type stored as value but another is stored as a reference in memory??















//This is fundamental to 
// how JavaScript (and many other programming languages) manages memory.
//on your computer's RAM (hardware on your device) 








//RAM has two areas named stack and heap which are used for different purposes
//which are managed by your JS engine 







//it is a softwar program that executes js code.
//The primary job of the JS engine is to 
//read your JavaScript code and convert it into machine code that the CPU can understand and run.


//where do you find it??









//web browsers 
//anyone knows what JS engine google uses?? v8
//firefox?? spiderMonkey







//where do we find it outside your web browsers??








//node
//it contains your JS engine to execute code on your computer
