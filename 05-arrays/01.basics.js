//so how do you store marks of your 5 subjects?

let m1 = 56;
let m2 = 75;
let m3 = 45;
let m4 = 95;

let scores = [56,75,45,95]
console.log(scores) //[ 56, 75, 45, 95 ]

let something = [56,"name",null, {
    city:"hyderabad",
    language:"telugu"
},[1,2,3]]

console.log(something);













//one way is to store each subject marks in their own variables like
//m1 = 65 //m2 = 50 //m3 = 70 //m4 = 45 //m5 = 82
//but most of the time you want to use that together and you need to have them together

//so what is the most effecient data structure to store this kind of data??
//arrays!

//we can store the same thing like this :

const marks = [87,92,45,63,72]

//this is called an array
//a way to store multiple values in a single variable

//the values can be of different data types

//for example
