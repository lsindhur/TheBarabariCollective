//so what does that even mean???

//when someone says primitive data types are stored as value
//but non primitives are stored as a reference in memory??

//think of the difference between your word document and your online google document

//you have used word document on your computer
//send it over email to your friend
//so what does that mean?? 
//that means she has a new copy of your document

//if she edits something on her document, does it change something on your doc??
//no right
//because YOU HAVE DIFFERENT COPIES!!


//simillarly think of another scenario
//you have created an online google document
//now you shared it with your friend by giving the link

//what happened here??
//do your friend and you have different copies or do you have the same link??

//same link right??

//now whatever you edit, it will also be reflecting when they view the document

//THAT IS THE SAME THING WHICH HAPPENS WITH YOUR PRIMITIVE AND NON PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES

//SUMMARY
//WHEN YOU ASSIGN A PRIMITVE DATA TYPE TO A VARIABLE, THEY HOLD THE VALUE
//WHEN YOU ASSIGN A OBJECT TO A VARIABLE, IT ONLY HOLD A REFERENCE IN MEMORY TO THT OBJECT
