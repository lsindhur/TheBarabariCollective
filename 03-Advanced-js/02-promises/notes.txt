//imagine you went for breakfast and ordered dosa at the counter
//the receptionist gives you a token which is a promise that they will deliver the ordered

//the promise can result in two outcomes

//either the restaurant gets you the dosa and fullfills their promise
//or due to some reason, they are unable to deliver dosa, they will cancel it
//or in other words, reject their promise

//so now even in JS, a promise is something like that
//A Promise in JavaScript is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous task.

//okay first let me ask how many of you understood what is a callback hell?
//callback hells represents callbacks within callbacks making the whole code harder to read
