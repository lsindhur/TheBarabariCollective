    /*
    Promise chain (.then chaining)

    Runs promises one after another.

    //Every .then call gives you a new promise.
    //If you return something â†’ itâ€™s like Promise.resolve(something).

    Each .then waits for the previous one to resolve.

    You can pass results forward to the next .then.

*/


//promise chaining is useful when 
/*
âœ… Steps happen in order.
âœ… Useful when the next step depends on previous data.
*/



/*

ðŸ”‘ When to use chaining vs Promise.all

Use promise chaining when tasks are sequential (one needs the result of the previous).

Use Promise.all when tasks are independent and can run in parallel.
