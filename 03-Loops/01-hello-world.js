//explanation and activity


//so I want you to all to write code to print numbers from 1 to 5



















//you see how repetitive tht is?
//now we are going to use a loop to print the numbers without any repetitive code
//js has many loops
//today we are going to discuss a "for loop" in JS


//loop - is a set of instructions that runs again and again until a certain condition is met

//when to use a for loop? - when you know how many times you want the loop to run


/*
for(initialization, condition, increment) {
//code to be executed
}
*/
//analogy ? condition - singing happy birthday until the candles are all blown
//code block - sing happy birthday


//what do you think this prints??

 for(let i=0; i<5; i++) {
    console.log(i); 
} 


/*
how the for loop works
- initialize
- check condition 
- execute the code
- increment it
- check condition 
- execute code
- increment it
- check condition 
-...

- until condition is not met
- then exit the code block

//activity
//write a for loop to print hello world 10 times

//numbers from 0 to 5


//DRY - DO NOT REPEAT YOURSELF
