//explanation, activity
//in tthe previous problem,we were increment by 1 value after each iteration
//but we can increment it by any value

/* for(let i=1; i<10; i+=2) {
    console.log(i);
} */

//tell me what values will be printed here??
//1,3,5,7,9
//2,4,6,8,10
//2,4,6,8
//




//now do this problem
//I want you to write a for loop to get the following outcome

//10
//20
//30
//40
//50
//60
//70
//80
//90
//100



//hello world ==> 10 times using for loop





for(let i=10; i<=100; i+=10) {
    console.log(i);
}
