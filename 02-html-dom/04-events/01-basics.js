//events in js

//https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Events

//Events are things that happen in the system you are programming,  ("system" refers to the environment where your code runs)
// which the system tells you about so your code can react to them. 
// For example, if the user clicks a button on a webpage, 
// you might want to react to that action by displaying an information box. 


//in other words
//The browser (the system) watches for interactions like mouse clicks, key presses, form submissions, etc.
//When one of those happens (an event), the browser can notify your code 
//— if you’ve told it what to do (using something like addEventListener).


//examples
//mouse events (click, doubleclick etc)
//keyboard events (keypress, keyup, keydown)
//form events (Submit)

//for example
//we can add an event listener to our button which will run only in response to the event happening
//lets say I want to print hello as soon as the user clicks the button

//access the button
