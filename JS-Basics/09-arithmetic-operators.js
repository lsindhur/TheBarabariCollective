//let's explore with code







let a = 5, b = 10;

/* console.log(a+b); //15
console.log(b-a); //5
console.log(b*a); //50
console.log(b/a); //2
console.log(b%a); //0
console.log(b**a) //100000 */

/* console.log("5"-2); //3
console.log("5"+2); //52 */













//we also have something caled unary operators which perform operations on a single operand

//increment means it will increment the value by 1 digit
//pre increment //addition happens before the value is used
//post increment //addition happens after the value is used

let x = 5;
/* console.log(++x); //6
console.log(x++); //6
console.log(x); //7 */




//console.log(x); //5






//activity

//what will be result of below statement
 let y = 5;
console.log(y++ + ++y);  //5+7 //12;

//y++ //5
//y //6
//++y //++6 //7
